# Relative
Relative is a js library to make it easier to use obscure DOM APIs to create Web Components, makingit easier to:
- Define custom elements
- Manage state
- Observe state changes
- Create elements
- Scope elements

The idea is to have a base with a small footprint, without any cli processing required. Just include it in your application and start gradually using it!

## Define Custom Element

index.html:
```

```

hello-world.html:
```

```
